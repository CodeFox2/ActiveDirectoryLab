<h1>VirtualBox - Active Directory Home Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project setup an active directory to simulate technology that would be used in an production environment. I achieved
this by downloading Windows 10 Pro and Server 2019 isoâ€™s and configured them as a client and
domain controller. I also setup the internal network by signing the IP address. After I created a
domain, configured NAT and routing to allow client access. Then I setup a DHCP to allow the
client to get an IP address that allows access to internet while remaining on the private internal
network. Finally, I ran a PowerShell script that created and added 1000+ users into the active directory. I ended this lab by testing the login and accessing the internet from the client's end.
